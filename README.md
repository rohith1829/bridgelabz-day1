## How to Run These Projects

To get started and run any of these Java assignments, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, open your terminal or Git Bash and clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rohit1829/bridgelabz-day1.git](https://github.com/rohit1829/bridgelabz-day1.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project folder:
    ```bash
    cd bridgelabz-day1
    ```

3.  **Open in your IDE:**
    Import the project into your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. Your IDE should automatically detect it as a Java project.

4.  **Compile and Run:**
    * Locate the `.java` file for the assignment you want to run (e.g., `AirportBoarding.java`).
    * Most of these assignments will contain a `public static void main(String[] args)` method, which is the entry point for execution.
    * You can then compile and run them directly from within your IDE.

    Alternatively, using the **command line**:
    ```bash
    # Example for AirportBoarding.java
    javac AirportBoarding.java  # Compiles the Java source file
    java AirportBoarding        # Runs the compiled Java class
    ```
